               will present some details from my life as an Entrepreneur, Executive, Developer, Comedian, Scuba Instructor, and Poker Player.";
topicCopy[1] = "I have always been entrepreneurial.  From starting a clamming business at 16 with the savings from my paper route, to
               started a consulting business in college providing statistical analysis, to founding multiple startups after graduate school.";
topicCopy[2] = "Over the years I have founded several more companies raising financing
               from both angel investors and well as venture capital firms.  In 1995 I founded Splash Studios, a game
               company that produced the interactive video CD-ROM Piper as well as Splash.com The Online Magazine for
               Kids. In 2000 I founded MrSwap.com, a site for trading movies, music and games, and in 2003 I founded
               All-Seeing Eye Inc. which took a small shareware product for videogame matchmaking developed by two
               young programmers in Finland and sold it to Yahoo!  I am currently working on plans for several other 
               startups in the areas of: online gaming, wearable technology, and live improvisational comedy using
               motion capture technology and real time 3D rendering.";
topicCopy[3] = "When not running my own small startups I have spent much of my career as a corporate executive working 
               for some of the largest companies in the world.  I have sometimes overseen product development activities
               and other times been in charge of marketing.  I have served in such positions as: Game Studio Vice President 
               for Fujitsu, Vice President of Marketing (and later VP of Product Development) for GameSpy, Sr. Vice 
               President of Social and Mobile Games for Atari.";
topicCopy[4] = "I discovered my passion for software development just 15 minutes into the first lecture of Computer Science
               101 in college.  I knew right then and there that this is what I wanted to do for a living.  I absorbed
               as much information as I could and learned to program in all of the current languages, and for all 
               operating systems.  For about the first decade of my career I developed software and was hired as a
               Software Design Engineer at Microsoft in the early 90's.  After leaving Microsoft I moved up the ranks
               into executive management and stopped actively coding.  I am looking forward to bringing my development
               skills back up to date and once again become an active developer.";
topicCopy[5] = "I realized one of my lifelong dreams of doing stand up comedy in 2007 when I took an 8-week workshop in 
               Los Angeles and did my debut show at the world famous Hollywood Improv.  Right away I was hooked and since
               then have performed hundreds of times at venues large and small, produced my own show called Comediaplex
               for three years and have appeared on TV in Last Comic Standing, and in more than a dozen online video shorts
               for sites such as Funny or Die.";

               both a rescue diver and certified instructor.";
topicCopy[7] = "One of my favorite interests is playing poker.  I have been playing since my teens and honed my skills in the 
               casinos of Lake Tahoe while living there for a winter in 1988.  Over the years I have won many live and online
               tournaments including fininshing in the money at The World Poker Tour.";
