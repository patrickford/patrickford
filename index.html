               started a consulting business in college providing statistical analysis, to founding multiple startups after graduate school.";

			   These included Level Four Interactive, Splash Studios, MrSwap.com, and The All-Seeing Eye Inc. which I sold to Yahoo!";
			topicCopy[3] = "I have spent much of my career as a corporate executive working for some of the largest companies in the world. \
			   I have sometimes overseen product development and other times been in charge of marketing.  I have worked for \
			   such companies as: Microsoft, Fujitsu, GameSpy, Yahoo, and Atari.";

               101 in college. I knew right then that this was what I wanted to do. For about the first decade of my career I developed \
               software before moving up into management. I am looking forward to bringing my development skills back up to date.";

               and did my debut at the Hollywood Improv. Right away I was hooked and since \
               have performed hundreds of times at venues large and small, have appeared on TV in \
               Last Comic Standing, and have been in more than a dozen online video shorts for sites such as Funny or Die.";
			topicCopy[6] = "I have been an avid scuba diver since 1990, and decided at age 43 to enroll in the training program to become \
               both a rescue diver and certified instructor. I most enjoy diving solo at night hunting spiny lobster in the \
               waters off of Laguna Beach and Malibu.";
			topicCopy[7] = "One of my favorite interests is playing poker. I have been playing since my teens and honed my skills in the \
               casinos of Lake Tahoe while living there for a winter. Over the years I have won many live and online \
               tournaments including finishing in the money at The World Poker Tour.";
